%head
    %title "String"
    %meta
%body

This is subordinate simply because it doesn't begin with `%`.

%.alternate

You need the percent, but you don't need to say div. You use markup in these
areas, so inline styles are markup, or HTML tags.

%code(language: javascript)

for (var i = 0; i < I; i++) {
}

%/code

Explicit close when necessary.

%table %tr %td %<

Here's how you would do this.

%< %td

Don't like it. Meh, it's okay.

%< %td

Another one.

%< %< %tr %td

And this is the next ro.

%table
    %tr
        %td
            This is an alernative.
