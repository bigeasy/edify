h1. Edify

Edify is my work in progress documentation generator that adheres to the
idiosyncrasies of my workflow; documentation first, documentation driven
development. I'm often coming up with a clever idea, but uncertain whether or
not I'm being to clever for the documentation, so I want to go and document it.

I don't like `README.md` for documentation for this reason. The `README.md` at
GitHub is the splash screen for the project. When people read it, they want to
be sold. But, I like to develop on master so that I can see my punch card make
progress every day. I also like to try out different ideas in documentation, so
if the `README.md` is where I document my code, people are always seeing the
confusion of the next version, instead of the clarity of the stable version.

Edify uses plain old markdown with fenced blocks.

```javascript
// Here is some javascript.
var a = 1
```

You configure Edify in the `gh-pages` branch of you git repository. Create a git
submodule to the **public** git repository. The GitHub pages engine will not be
able to checkout a private module.

Alternatively, you can publish an Edify web site using `rsync` to a server that
you manage.

Edify documentation is supposed to look nice when viewed at GitHub, but it can also
be formatted specially. There is a format that you can use to define the bits and
pieces of your program. It has JavaScript in mind, but you can define your own parsers
for the information.
